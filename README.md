# Image Processing Project

This project aims to create a web app that takes an image as an input, and then using a pre-trained machine learning model we predict whether the image is of a cat or a dog.
The results are displayed on the webapp with a probability precentile of that image being an image of a cat or a dog.

The model is created using Tensorflow.
The webapp is created using Flask
